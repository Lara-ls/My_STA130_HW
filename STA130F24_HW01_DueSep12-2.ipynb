    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",

    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "In our discussion, we covered the following topics related to data handling in pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas `df.describe()` Method**:\n",
    "   - **`count`**: Number of non-null entries in each column.\n",
    "   - **`mean`**: Average value of the entries in each column.\n",
    "   - **`std`**: Standard deviation, indicating the dispersion of data around the mean.\n",
    "   - **`min`**: Minimum value in each column.\n",
    "   - **`25%`**: 25th percentile, or the first quartile (Q1).\n",
    "   - **`50%`**: 50th percentile, or the median.\n",
    "   - **`75%`**: 75th percentile, or the third quartile (Q3).\n",
    "   - **`max`**: Maximum value in each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Missing Data**:\n",
    "   - **`df.dropna()`**: Removes rows or columns with missing values (NaNs). Parameters allow specifying how strict the removal should be (`how='any'`, `how='all'`, or `thresh` for a minimum number of non-NaN values).\n",
    "   - **`del df['col']`**: Deletes a specific column from the DataFrame. This operation is permanent and removes the column from `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Order of Operations**:\n",
    "   - **Applying `del df['col']` before `df.dropna()`**:\n",
    "     - Removing unnecessary columns before dropping rows with missing values helps simplify the DataFrame, avoid unwanted data loss, and potentially improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion aimed to clarify the functions and best practices for managing and analyzing data in pandas DataFrames.\n",

    "#### 8. Give brief explanations in your own words for any requested answers to the questions below\n",
    "\n",
    "> This problem will guide you through exploring how to use a ChatBot to troubleshoot code using the \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv\" data set \n",
    "> \n",
    "> To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatBot, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from \"2\" above\n",
    "> - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the \"titanic\" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "    \n",
    "> If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Forget to include `import pandas as pd` in your code \n",
    "       <br> \n",
    "       Use Kernel->Restart from the notebook menu to restart the jupyter notebook session unload imported libraries and start over so you can create this error\n",
    "       <br><br>\n",
    "       When python has an error, it sometimes provides a lot of \"stack trace\" output, but that's not usually very important for troubleshooting. For this problem for example, all you need to share with ChatGPT or search on google is `\"NameError: name 'pd' is not defined\"`<br><br>\n",

    "    2. Mistype \"titanic.csv\" as \"titanics.csv\"\n",
    "       <br> \n",

    "       <br><br>\n",
    "       Explore introducing typos into a couple other parts of the url and note the slightly different errors this produces<br><br>\n",

    "       <br> \n",
    "       You can simulate this by just misnaming the variable. For example, if you should write `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` based on how you loaded the data, then instead write `DF.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`\n",
    "       <br><br>\n",
    "       Make sure you've fixed your file name so that's not the error any more<br><br>\n",
